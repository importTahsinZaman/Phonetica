# Phonetica

Countless families immigrate to the United States every year and struggle to help their child succeed in school. This often snowballs into the child having difficulty later in life finding a job and feeling left out of American society and lacking potential. While children whose families have been speaking English for generations are able to go home and receive extra help and even just soak up more English due to their environment, immigrant students have to wait until school the next day to hopefully get at most 50 minutes of help in ELA class. Phonetica hopes to change this by giving immigrant families the ability to sit down with their children and read English story books together, despite not knowing how to perfectly read English themselves. Phonetica is powered by AI OCR and translation software which allows for easy scanning of text and precise translation. Phonetica also provides in depth explanation into the definition and usage of words in a book, which goes beyond confusing and often incorrect dictionary definitions to instead provide more clear and long lasting education into English vocabulary. Phonetica also provides a suite of learning tools such as flashcards which allow users to practice what they have already learned and gain exposure to new language. 

Note that the images of book covers and text from books in the screenshots below are not exemplary of the sorts of materials families will be using Phonetica for and are merely a placeholder. The target age for Phonetica is 4 to 13.
